In this post, we want to know how her music has changed a small-town country artist to become one of the most recognized musicians/singer-songwriters of this generation. Through her songwriting, sound, and stanza, witness how she used to believe that love was burning red but it's golden like daylight.

## Who's Taylor Swift, Anyway?

Hi all. Before we dwell into the musical intricacies of Taylor Swift, we have to know her. There are three main things that can define her: 

1. Owner of `Love Story` and other songs from `Fearless`.
2. First woman to win Grammy Album of The Year three times.
3. Track number 5, easter eggs, and hidden vaults for each album.

Indeed, they were rare. We were there and we remembered them all too well.

## Our Data

For this project, data were gathered from different sources. We scraped the lyrics from [genius](https://genius.com/) through `genius` package by `R`. Only the standard versions were used so it has only **137** tracks. The songs used for movies and songs in deluxe version such as `Ours`, `Crazier`, and `Safe and Sound` were not there. The code is provided on the same repository under `codes` folder.

To add the songwriting and producing credits dataset, the track listing section of albums in [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) were scraped. Since all of them are in table-ready format and there are nine album, it can be copied and formatted with `Excel`. In this dataset, it has **146** tracks, excluding the track used in films and the bonus tracks from `Fearless`.

Finally, to get the audio features of each tracks across albums, `Python` codes from [Rare Loot](https://rareloot.medium.com/extracting-spotify-data-on-your-favourite-artist-via-python-d58bc92a4330) and `R` codes from [Simran Vatsa](https://medium.com/@simranvatsa5/taylor-f656e2a09cc3) were tweaked since the former retrieved only the first twenty-five album and the package does not distinguish between what is a full album and what is a single while the latter is deprecated in the latest version. Hence, the package `spotifyr` should be installed locally. Since all movie tracks and bonus tracks from `Speak Now` onwards were not included, we have **142** in all. By using `inner` join in all datasets, we have **137** tracks.

The clean versions of the datasets are in the `dataset` of the same repository. And that's how it works. That's how you get the data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

As a first part of our [Taylor Series](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TaylorSeries.html), it was decided to analyze the dataset separately and use them altogether in the next installation. 

### Taylor Swift Through Songwriting

Taylor had solely written **42** out of **146** as of this dataset. Furthermore, she has solely penned all but one song in her `Speak Now` album. Among her co-writers, Jack Antonoff had written with her the most for **25** in which **9** of them were from `Lover`. As a pair, Max Martin and Shellback worked together for the lyrics in 20 instances, particularly the three singles from `Red` and almost half of the album from both `1989` and `reputation`, the album where the pop music is significantly shown. While Jack Antonoff had worked with **7** other writers across all albums `post-Red`, Max Martin and Shellback have **6** common connections among Taylor's other writers even they worked only on three albums.

On the other hand, she had co-produced **82** out of all tracks, in which **41** of those are with Nathan Chapman, her main producer from all albums before `1989` and **28** from Jack Antonoff across all albums from `1989` onwards. For the main producer in `evermore` Aaron Dessner, he has worked with her on the production side for **4** times. One interesting observation is that the three main producers never worked all together for a song. Also, Aaron and Jack worked only for `Betty` in `folklore`. As shown by the table below, Max Martin worked the most for the production of tracks in `1989`.

Among all connections, there is a single pair separated from the rest since they solely worked on `A Perfectly Good Heart` from the debut album.

After her debut album, she started in handling the production of the songs along with Nathan Chapman. After the success of `Fearless` and amid the criticisms that se got lucky because of other musicians in her album, she started owning both the writing and producing aspects of a song. As she transitioned to a more pop sounding era, she sought help from Max Martin and Shellback for great hooks as shown in `Blank Space` and `Shake It Off`. Hence, their collective cohesiveness had earned them another Grammy Album of the Year and the critics' approval in terms of year-end and decade-end polls. 

While `reputation` has relatively happier love songs, Taylor worked more with Antonoff and helped fully uncovered her feelings in `Lover` and `Daylight`as she had hinted songs about her current lover. The album `reputation` may be a catharsis for her state while `Lover` is the happier result of that. When the pandemic came, she and her supporters have a lot going on at the moment when Swift dropped `folklore` and `evermore` within a year. As the albums cater more to the alternative-loving folk, she worked with Aaron Dessner for the lyrics and music. Once again, she has won another AOTY. 

What comes after `evermore` and her version of `Fearless`? Will she work again with `Nathan Chapman` or drop the last of the `folklore` trilogy? Anyway, are you ready for it?

### Taylor Swift Through Sound

To understand how her sound had changed as she wondered across three genres, the spotify audio features dataset was used. Only nine numeric features spanning three main characteristics such as _mood_, _properties_, and _context_. All except `loudness` and `tempo` have range of scores from **0** to **1**. The former typically ranged from **-60** to **0** while the latter is always non-negative. The first four will cover the first main characteristic while the last two is under _context_. The rest is under the second characteristic.

Before we dwell into the features, let us look at the key she used in recording the tracks. The major key is in **129** out of **142** while the rest, which is **13** is in minor key. Out of those **129**, only **22** of those are in C major, the people's key and key of [innocence and simplicity](https://americansongwriter.com/songwriter-u-on-c-major/). She has used this more extensively in her `Lover` album than other ones. The "B major", "D# major", "G minor" were only used once, in tracks produced by Aaron Dessner.

1. `Danceability` - how danceable or suitable for dancing a track is. The higher, the more danceable. `The Archer` and `I Think He Knows`, both from album `Lover`, have the lowest and highest score respectively in this metric.
2. `Valence` - how positive a track musically conveys. The higher, the more positive. `Delicate` from `reputation` and `Shake It Off` from `1989` have the extreme values.
3. `Energy` - how loud, fast, and noisy a track feels. The higher, the more intense it channels. `new year's day` exudes the lowest energy while `Haunted` from `Speak Now` exhibits the opposite.
4. `Tempo` - as measured in beats per minute, how fast a track is. The higher, the faster. `Soon You'll Get Better` and `Lover`, both from album `Lover`, have the highest and lowest score respectively in this metric.
5. `Loudness` - often correlated with `Energy`, it measures how loud a track is. The higher, the louder. `hoax` from `folklore` and `Picture To Burn` from the debut album occupy both extremes.
6. `Speechiness` - it measures the presence of spoken words in a track. The higher, the more significant a spoken word's presence is. While `Teardrops On My Guitar` garnered the lowest score, both `Stay Stay Stay` from `Red` and `I Forgot That You Existed` from `Lover` have the highest score.
7. `Instrumentalness` - it represents the amount of vocals in a track. The ooh's and aah's are counted as vocals. The closer to **1**, the greater likelihood that it has no vocal presence. **Fifty-seven** tracks have a score of zero while `long story short` from `evermore` has the highest score of **0.179**.
8. `Liveness` - it is a likelihood that a track is recorded with a live audience. The higher, the closer it is to a live track. `The Story Of Us` and `Back to December`, both from `Speak Now`, have the lowest and highest likelihoods, accordingly.
9. `Acousticness` - how acoustic a track is. The higher, the more acoustic it is. `State Of Grace` from `Red` has the lowest score while `It's Nice To Have a Friend` from `Lover` has the highest score.

From these metric, it can be observed that 6 of the "extreme" tracks came from the `Lover` album. Can it be said that it is the least cohesive album among the nine? To measure the cohesiveness of an album.
