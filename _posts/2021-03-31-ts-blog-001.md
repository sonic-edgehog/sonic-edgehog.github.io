## Who's Taylor Swift, Anyway?

Hi all. Before we dwell into the musical intricacies of Taylor Swift, we have to know her. There are three main things that can define her: 

1. Owner of `Love Story` and other songs from `Fearless`.
2. First woman to win Grammy Album of The Year three times.
3. Track number 5, easter eggs, and hidden vaults for each album.

Indeed, they were rare. We were there and we remembered them all too well.

## Our Data

For this project, data were gathered from different sources. We scraped the lyrics from [genius](https://genius.com/) through `genius` package by `R`. Only the standard versions were used so it has only **137 tracks**. The songs used for movies and songs in deluxe version such as `Ours`, `Crazier`, and `Safe and Sound` were not there. The code is provided on the same repository under `codes` folder.

To add the songwriting and producing credits dataset, the track listing section of albums in [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) were scraped. Since all of them are in table-ready format and there are nine album, it can be copied and formatted with `Excel`. In this dataset, it has **146** tracks, excluding the track used in films and the bonus tracks from `Fearless`.

Finally, to get the audio features of each tracks across albums, `Python` codes from [Rare Loot](https://rareloot.medium.com/extracting-spotify-data-on-your-favourite-artist-via-python-d58bc92a4330) and `R` codes from [Simran Vatsa](https://medium.com/@simranvatsa5/taylor-f656e2a09cc3) were tweaked since the former retrieved only the first twenty-five album and the package does not distinguish between what is a full album and what is a single while the latter is deprecated in the latest version. Hence, the package `spotifyr` should be installed locally. Since all movie tracks and bonus tracks from `Speak Now` onwards were not included, we have **142** in all. By using `inner` join in all datasets, we have **137** tracks.

The clean versions of the datasets are in the `dataset` of the same repository. And that's how it works. That's how you get the data.
